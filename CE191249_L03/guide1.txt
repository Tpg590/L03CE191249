Introduction:
This is a word-guessing game (Hangman).

How to Play:

Press 1 to choose a topic. After selecting a topic, you will see _ _ _ _ _ _.
The number of underscores varies depending on the randomly chosen word.

After _ _ _ _ _ appears, the player can enter any letter to guess. However, special characters and numbers are not allowed.

If the player enters a long string like "Anh Teo yeu bong da", the system will only take the first letter, "A".

If the guess is correct, _ _ _ _ will automatically be replaced with the guessed letter.

If a word contains multiple occurrences of the guessed letter (e.g., "D" in "ADD"), _ _ _ will be replaced with _ D D.

Each game allows five incorrect guesses. Each incorrect guess decreases the remaining attempts, while correct guesses do not affect the count.

If the number of incorrect guesses reaches zero, it's Game Over. If the player correctly guesses the word before that, they Win.

How to Create a New Topic:

Press 2 to create a new topic. First, you must enter a topic name.

If the topic name is already taken (either from previously created topics or the game's default topics), you must enter a new name.

After successfully naming the topic, enter the number of words (minimum 1, maximum 9).

Then, enter the words that will be used in the guessing game.

Once all steps are completed, congratulations! You have successfully created your own custom topic.
